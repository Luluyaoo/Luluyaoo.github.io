            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am from China and came to the United States to study when I was a child. As a bilingual English-Chinese speaker I am familiar with both English and Chinese.
                Business is a field of study that I am very interested in and it has always been my chosen career path throughout my academic career. I believe that I can fulfill any business task to the best of my ability throughout my studies.
                The study of Economics has enabled me to analyze the direction of the economy through data and graphs. I believe that my studies will be able to make a difference in the community in terms of business.
